## Prerequisites

**iOS**
- XCode
- Pod (CocoaPods) for iOS
- An iOS device or emulator with iOS 12.0 or above.
- **Ensure that you have configured the provisioning profile in Xcode to run the app on a physical device.**

   ```

2. Checkout v5 branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout v5
   ```

3. Open the project in Android Studio by navigating to the cloned directory.

4. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch all dependencies.

5. `[Optional]` Configure CometChat credentials:
   - Open the `app_credentials.dart` file located at `sample_app/lib/app_credentials.dart` and enter your CometChat _`App ID`_, _`Region`_, and _`Auth Key`_:
     ```dart
     AppCredentials {
        static String _appId = "YOUR_APP_ID";
        static String _authKey = "YOUR_AUTH_KEY";
        static String _region = "REGION";
     }
     ```
