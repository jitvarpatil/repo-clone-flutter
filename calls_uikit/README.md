The CometChat Flutter Calls UI Kit provides a pre-built user interface kit that developers can use to quickly integrate a reliable & fully-featured chat experience into an existing or a new app.

### Prerequisites

## Getting Started
To set up Flutter Calls UIKit and utilize CometChat for your chat and calls functionality, you'll need to follow these steps:
- Register at the [CometChat Dashboard](https://app.cometchat.com/) to create an account.
